# Screen Time Analyzer

A Python tool to analyze Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) usage time, bypassing the limitations of "Screen Time" data export.

## How It Works
Since Apple does not provide a direct API or export for Screen Time data, this project relies on **Shortcuts** that run periodically on your devices.
These shortcuts save a text file containing a list of apps and their cumulative daily usage time.
The files are manually exported in Markdown format.

The software:
1. Reads the log files generated by the shortcuts.
2. Parses the data (handling multiple formats and timestamps).
3. Saves raw data into a local SQLite database (`data/db/screentime.db`).
4. Calculates **usage intervals** by computing the difference between consecutive snapshots.
5. Archives the processed files.
6. Visualizes the data via an interactive **Streamlit Dashboard**.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ScreenTimeAnalyzer.git
    cd ScreenTimeAnalyzer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Shortcut Setup
Create an automation on iOS/iPadOS that:
- Gets "Screen Time" details.
- Formats the data (App Name and Time).
- Appends text to a file in a synced folder (e.g., iCloud Drive or local folder).
- Ensures the file starts with a recognizable date/time header (e.g., "14 Feb 2026 at 2:00 PM").
- **Note**: If the file contains multiple snapshots appended one after another, the parser will handle them correctly.

### 2. Loading Data
Copy or sync the files generated by the shortcuts into subfolders in `data/`.
The name of the subfolder will be used as the **Device Name** in the database.
Example structure:
- `data/Activity iPhone/`
- `data/Activity iPad/`
- `data/Macbook/`

### 3. Running the Dashboard
The easiest way to use the tool is via the Dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

From the dashboard you can:
- **View Charts**: Weekly activity specific to device and year.
- **Update Data**: Click the **"🔄 Update Data"** button in the sidebar to ingest new files from the `data/` folder and update the database instantly.

### (Alternative) Manual Ingestion
You can also run the ingestion script manually via terminal:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Privacy Note
All data is stored locally in `data/db/screentime.db`.
The `.gitignore` is configured to exclude the entire `data/` directory, ensuring your personal usage data is never uploaded to the repository.
